This is a library that allows widget developers to set a custom icon on the Notifications setting table.

To use it with your widget add a key named "IconFile" to your widgets Info.plist and then place the icon in the bundle.

A crappy example is inside the test folder.

I will not release this as a binary or support it until iOS 5 is publicly released.
